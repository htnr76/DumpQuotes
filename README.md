### Simple and fun project that uses [Tronald Dump API](https://www.tronalddump.io/) to fetch data and React to display it combined with Tailwind CSS.

## Usage

1. **Clone repo**: 
   ```terminal 
   git clone <LINK>
   ````

2. **Enter repo**:
```terminal
cd dump 
```

3. **Install Modules:**
```terminal 
npm install
```

4. **Install Tailwind CSS (if needed):**
###### If the project uses Tailwind CSS and it's not listed in package.json, you need to install it. Run:
```terminal 
npm install tailwindcss
```

5. **Set up Tailwind CSS (if needed):**
###### After installing Tailwind CSS, you might need to set it up. This typically involves creating a configuration file (usually named tailwind.config.js). Generate it by running:

```terminal 
npx tailwindcss init
```

6. **Run the app:**
```terminal 
npm start
```


#### Following these steps will get the "DumpQuotes" React app up and running on your local machine. Make sure to replace <LINK> with the actual URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.
